ft_temp_data.csv
This file contains the temperature data in Celcius for each logger. The time column contains the data and time of the temperature reading.
The remaining columns are the IDs of the loggers. These loggers are assigned treatments and Tray IDs in the logger_id_freeze_thaw.csv

The freeze-thaw treatments began on January 2, 2023 and ended on January 9, 2023 at which point the samples were moved to the growth chamber.
